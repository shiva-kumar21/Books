        <h2>The 3 mistakes of my life</h2> <br>
        <p>Harry James Potter (b. 31 July 1980) was an English half-blood wizard and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter, Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish his arch-enemy, Lord Voldemort. Voldemort made his first attempt to circumvent the prophecy when Harry was a year and three months old. This attempt led to the murder of Harry's parents as they tried to protect him. However, this unsuccessful attempt to kill Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall and marked the end of the First Wizarding War. Harry became known as "The Boy Who Lived" as he was the only known survivor of the Killing Curse due to his mother's loving sacrifice, which magically protected him.</p>
